# daily-planner

## Description

This is daily planner designed to help a busy individual plan and keep track of their weekly commitments. This project was a chance to apply many of the concepts learnt inside and out of class, including event delegation, local storage, persistent data, and jQuery. I enjoyed tackling this project and particularly liked discovering a solution to prevent duplicate timeblock code within the HTML.

## Credits

The HTML and CSS (except for minor adjustments) for this project was provided by edX. In addition to the following links, the class sessions held by the edX front-end bootcamp team have been invaluable for this challenge, especially in my understanding of JQuery and event delegation.
